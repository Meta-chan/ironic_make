# Welcome to Ironic Make!
Ironic Make is an unusual build system. It...
 - Consists of only one file â€“ `build.bat`
 - Is specific to C and C++
 - Automatically detects installed compilers
 - Has small size and can be built in every repository
 - Can be fully customized for every repository
 - Requires no installed programs (except of compilers of course)
 - Has literally no place to cause errors
 - Is very simple. Nothing can be simpler than double-clicking `build.bat`, can it?

# Supported compilers
 - Microsoft Visual Studio

###### P.S. My code is not dirty, it is alternatively clean.
